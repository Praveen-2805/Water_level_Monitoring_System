# Water_level_Monitoring_System
The Water Level Monitoring System uses an ESP32 microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level in a tank. The data is then displayed on an HTML page, accessible through a phone or any web-enabled device. This provides real-time updates and allows users to monitor the water level remotely for convenient and efficient management.
